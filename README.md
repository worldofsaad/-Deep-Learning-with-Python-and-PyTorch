# Deep Learning with Python and PyTorch
I used Python and its popular libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, as well as the PyTorch Deep Learning library. I then applied them to build Neural Networks and Deep Learning models.

## 1. Tensors and Gradients
- **Tensors**: Tensors are an essential part of PyTorch; there are complex mathematical objects in and of themselves. Fortunately, most of the intricacies are not necessary. In this section, I compared them to vectors and numpy arrays.

- **Derivatives**: In this section, took a look at simple derivatives and partial derivatives. And went over a cool hack that allows you to calculate the derivative of a function for multiple values using PyTorch Library.

- **Dataset**: In this section, I constructed a basic dataset by using PyTorch and learnt how to apply basic transformations to it. Also, used a prebuilt dataset and then used some prebuilt dataset transforms.

## 2. Fundamentals of Linear Regression
- **Linear Regression 1D Training One Parameter**: In this section, I trained a model with PyTorch by using data that I created. The model only has one parameter: the slope

- **Linear regression 1D Training Two Parameter**: In this section, I trained a model with PyTorch by using the data that I created. The model will have the slope and bias. And l reviewed how to make a prediction in several different ways by using PyTorch
